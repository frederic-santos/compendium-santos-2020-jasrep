  abstract = {Background. \textendash{} The existence of effective reference treatments means that the superior therapeutic efficacy of new treatments is less marked and thus more difficult to demonstrate statistically. Moreover, the potential value of a new treatment is also based on other criteria, such as costs, ease of use, non invasiveness, and immediate or long-term side effects. In this context, methodological issue becomes one of looking for equivalence or non inferiority of the new treatment in comparison with an existing, high-performance reference treatment. Methods. \textendash{} In the present work, we reexamine the statistical rational and methodological features of equivalence and noninferiority trials. Results. \textendash{} We address equivalence margin choice, hypotheses building, and the different approaches for establishing equivalence (hypothesis testing and confidence intervals). We then discuss key aspects of equivalence trial design and the important methodological quality criteria involved in performing such studies: choice of the reference treatment, subject eligibility criteria, primary endpoint, study population and the required sample size. Lastly, we consider the possibility of adopting a new analytical strategy (noninferiority/superiority). Conclusion. \textendash{} A checklist of items to include when reporting the results of randomized controlled trials (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials, the CONSORT recommendations) has been adapted for use in noninferiority and equivalence randomized controlled trials.

  abstract = {There is over 60 years of discussion in the statistical literature concerning the misuse and limitations of null hypothesis significance tests (NHST). Based on the prevalence of NHST in biological anthropology research, it appears that the discipline generally is unaware of these concerns. The p values used in NHST usually are interpreted incorrectly. A p value indicates the probability of the data given the null hypothesis. It should not be interpreted as the probability that the null hypothesis is true or as evidence for or against any specific alternative to the null hypothesis. P values are a function of both the sample size and the effect size, and therefore do not indicate whether the effect observed in the study is important, large, or small. P values have poor replicability in repeated experiments. The distribution of p values is continuous and varies from 0 to 1.0. The use of a cut-off, generally p   0.05, to separate significant from nonsignificant results, is an arbitrary dichotomization of continuous variation. In 2016, the American Statistical Association issued a statement of principles regarding the misinterpretation of NHST, the first time it has done so regarding a specific statistical procedure in its 180-year history. Effect sizes and confidence intervals, which can be calculated for any data used to calculate p values, provide more and better information about tested hypotheses than p values and NHST.},

  shorttitle = {The Mean Measure of Divergence},
  abstract = {The mean measure of divergence (MMD) distance statistic has been used by researchers for nearly 50 years to assess inter-sample phenetic affinity. Its widespread and often successful use is well documented, especially in the study of cranial and dental nonmetric traits. However, the statistic has accumulated some undesired mathematical baggage through the years from various workers in their attempts to improve or alter its performance. Others may not fully understand how to apply the MMD or interpret its output, whereas some described a number of perceived shortcomings. As a result, the statistic and its sometimes flawed application(s) have taken several well-aimed hits; a few researchers even argued that it should no longer be utilized or, at least, that its use be reevaluated. The objective of this report is to support the MMD, and in the process: (1) provide a brief history of the statistic, (2) review its attributes and applicability relative to the often-used Mahalanobis D2 statistic for nonmetric traits, (3) compare results from MMD and D2 model-free analyses of previously-recorded sub-Saharan African dental samples, and (4) investigate its utility for model-bound analyses. In the latter instance, the ability of the D2 and other squared Euclidean-based statistics to approximate a genetic relationship matrix and Sewall Wright's fixation index using phenotypic data, and the inability of the MMD to do so, is addressed. Three methods for obtaining such results with nonlinear MMD distances, as well as an assessment of the fit of the isolation-by-distance model, are presented. Am. J. Hum.

In this paper the commonly used methods are evaluated in light of statistical considerations and degree of sample preservation. In particular, we explore the question of dependence between sides for the bilateral traits. Several workers have tested for bilateral trait correlation in incorrect ways, confusing tests for differences in side frequencies with tests for independence. An easy method to test for independence, using the chisquared test, is recommended. This test is used on 16 bilateral traits in a large sample of prehistoric crania from Central California and significant dependence is found for all 16 of these traits. We suggest the traditional method of deriving frequencies be used. Both sides of the cranium should be considered, dividing the number of times the trait occurs by the number of sides available for observation. This method can be used even in poorly preserved samples. Side to side correlation may be compensated for by modifying the constants subtracted in the mean measure of divergence and in the expression for the approximate variance of the mean measure of divergence when the samples are drawn from identical populations.},

  shorttitle = {Body Mass Estimation from the Skeleton},
  abstract = {Estimating an individual body mass (BM) from the skeleton is a challenge for forensic anthropology. However, identifying someone's BMI (Body Mass Index) category, i.e. underweight, normal, overweight or obese, could contribute to identification. Individual BM is also known to influence the age-at-death estimation from the skeleton. Several methods are regularly used by both archaeologists and forensic practitioners to estimate individual BM. The most commonly used methods are based on femoral head breadth, or stature and bi-iliac breadth. However, those methods have been created from mean population BMs and are therefore meant to estimate the average BM of a population. Being that they are based on individual BM data and estimated femoral cortical areas, the newest published methods are supposed to be more accurate. We evaluated the accuracy and reliability of the most commonly used and most recent BM estimation methods (n = 11) on a sample of 64 individuals. Both sexes and all BMI categories are represented, as well as a wide range of BM. Ages in this sample range from 20 to 87 years of age. Absolute and real differences between actual BM and estimated BM were assessed; they determined the accuracy for individual BM estimation and for average BM estimation of a population, respectively. The proportion of the sample whose estimated BM falls within {\AE}10\% and {\AE}20\% of their actual BM determines the reliability of the methods in our sample for, respectively, individual BM estimation and average BM of a population. The tested methods result in an absolute difference of 11 kg\textendash{}26 kg {\AE} 10 kg with regards to prediction of individuals actual BM. The real differences are very variable from method to method, ranging from {\`A}14 kg to 25 kg. None of the tested methods is able to estimate BM of half of the sample within {\AE}10\% of their actual BM but most of them can estimate BM of more than half of the sample within {\AE}20\% of their actual BM. The errors increase with increasing BM, demonstrating a bias in all the methods. No bone variable tested correlated with BM. BMI categories were correctly predicted for less than 50\% of the sample in most cases. In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the 11 methods tested are not suited for estimating individual BM or for predicting BMI categories. However, they are accurate and reliable enough for estimating the average BM of a population.},

  abstract = {Menarche is an indicator frequently used to study variation in growth, development, and related health conditions among members of living populations. As a life event, menarche is often associated with changes in an individual's social identity. The reproductive lifespan, which for females starts with menarche, is a paramount feature of palaeodemographic studies. Determination of menarche status from the skeletal remains of individuals of past populations can be obtained by assessing the developmental status of the iliac crest, as well as the hand and wrist bones, which are, unlike teeth, often poorly recovered in bioarchaeological contexts. The present study seeks to evaluate the link between dental mineralization and menarche in a population of known menarche status. The relationship between permanent teeth mineralization and menarche status was investigated by using data of developing permanent teeth (167 radiographs) rated in accordance with the well-known standards of Demirjian et al. and Moorrees et al. collected among 73 living French females of known menarcheal status. Using correlation ratios, GLMM and CART algorithm, menarcheal status is correlated with mineralization of the premolars. Menarcheal status is predicted correctly for 92 and 77\% of radiographs of the learning and validation samples, respectively. Although promising, the results require caution prior to generalization to other populations. The age of menarche in this particular sample may simply coincide with the development of the premolars in this particular sample. Therefore, further investigation applied to populations with various mean ages of menarche is required in order to provide new evidence of variation in human growth and development from the correspondence between the mineralization of the permanent teeth and menarche.},

Sex determination methods based on craniometrics are widely used and known to be specific to several factors (e.g. sample distribution, population, age, secular trends, measurement technique, etc.). The goal of this study is to discuss the potential variations linked to the statistical treatment of the data. Traditional craniometrics of four samples extracted from documented osteological collections (from Portugal, France, the U.S.A., and Thailand) were used to test three different classification methods: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machines (SVM). The Portuguese sample was set as a training model on which the other samples were applied in order to assess the validity and reliability of the different models. The tests were performed using different parameters: some included the selection of the best predictors; some included a strict decision threshold (sex assessed only if the related posterior probability was high, including the notion of indeterminate result); and some used an unbalanced sex-ratio. Results indicated that LR tends to perform slightly better than the other techniques and offers a better selection of predictors. Also, the use of a decision threshold (i.e. p {$>$} 0.95) is essential to ensure an acceptable reliability of sex determination methods based on craniometrics. Although the Portuguese, French, and American samples share a similar sexual dimorphism, application of Western models on the Thai sample (that displayed a lower degree of dimorphism) was unsuccessful.},

At the Grotte du Renne, Arcy-sur-Cure, France, the Cha\textasciicircum{}telperronian levels contain Neandertal remains and large numbers of personal ornaments, decorated bone tools and colorants, but it has been suggested that this association reflects intrusion of the symbolic artifacts from the overlying Protoaurignacian and/or of the Neandertal remains from the underlying Mousterian.
Methodology/Principal Findings: We tested these hypotheses against the horizontal and vertical distributions of the various categories of diagnostic finds and statistically assessed the probability that the Cha\textasciicircum{}telperronian levels are of mixed composition. Our results reject that the associations result from large or small scale, localized or generalized postdepositional displacement, and they imply that incomplete sample decontamination is the parsimonious explanation for the stratigraphic anomalies seen in the radiocarbon dating of the sequence.

  abstract = {Objectives: The human femoral diaphysis is often used to reconstruct loading histories (mobility, activity, body mass). The proximal femur is known to be differentially affected by changes in total fat-mass (FM), fat-free mass (FFM), and body fat percentage (BF\%), but the adaptation of the entire diaphysis to body composition has not been thoroughly characterized to date. Understanding how the femoral diaphysis adapts to body components would benefit biomechanical interpretations of the femoral variation and nutrition-related studies.
Methods: Combining various methods from clinical nutrition, biological anthropology, and geometric morphometrics, we evaluated the correlation of measures taken on the entire femoral diaphysis with estimated FM, FFM, and BF\% from 61 CT scans (17 females, 44 males). The sample was predominantly composed of people with obesity.
Results: Cortical area of the cross-sections and local cortical thickness showed high correlation with BF\% in particular, in females only. The curvature significantly decreased with FM and BF\% in both sexes. The lowest correlations are found with FFM.
Conclusions: The observed sexual dimorphism is consistent with differing aging processes; cortical bone decreases in females through endosteal resorption while it remains almost constant in males who compensate for endosteal resorption by periosteal apposition on the diaphyseal surface. The functional adaptation to compressive forces indicates a systemic endosteal apposition of bone material with increased BF\% and FM in females only. FM and BF\% are linked to a straighter femur in both sexes, suggesting an optimization of the resistance to compressive loads by distributing them more linearly along the entire diaphysis.},

As assemblage size grows, the false positive rate becomes unimportant and the false negative rate becomes significant. Size disparity among the commingled individuals plays a significant role in method performance, showing that case-specific circumstances (e.g. assemblage size and size disparity) will determine method power.},

  abstract = {A case is reported that involves the commingled skeletal remains of two individuals who died in a helicopter crash in 1969 during the Vietnam War. The incomplete portions of two bodies were initially recovered soon after the crash. These portions were identified by personnel at a U.S. Army Mortuary in Saigon and were returned to the next-of-kin. While searching for scrap metal in 2002, a Vietnamese citizen unexpectedly discovered human remains and personal effects interspersed with buried aircraft wreckage. The personal effects correlated with the individuals who died in the 1969 incident. These newly discovered remains and artifacts were subsequently received at the U.S. Army Central Identification Laboratory, Hawaii (CILHI) for analysis. As part of the CILHI analysis it was necessary to segregate the commingled remains into specific individuals for identification purposes. Details regarding various sorting techniques are described that provide a solid framework for systematically dealing with small-scale commingling. The sorting techniques used in the resolution of this case consist of visual pair-matching, articulation, process of elimination, osteometric comparison, and taphonomy. These techniques, when used in conjunction with each other, provided a solid basis for the individualization of most skeletal elements.},

  abstract = {The biological profile of human remains is fundamental for understanding the structure of past societies and their life histories. However, the assessment of the demographics of an assemblage is hindered when dealing with commingled burials. Consequently, methods for sorting commingled skeletons are essential in a bioarchaeological context. The aim of this study was to provide insight into osteometric sorting techniques when dealing with archaeological commingled skeletal remains. For the purposes of this research, Byrd and LeGarde's pair-matching osteometric sorting and regression models, which use measurements created for fragmented bones, were tested on 61 adult individuals exhumed from single burial plots from five different Greek archaeological sites. The results showed that the regression models exhibit much lower rates of true positive results (18.2\textendash{}67.6\% and 4.8\textendash{}71.7\% for the left and right side, respectively) than the pair-matching model (74.1\textendash{}89.5\%), whereas the rates of the false positive results are almost equivalent (approximately 20\textendash{}35\%). Therefore, the application of the pair-matching osteometric sorting model can provide a set of potential matches in an archaeological context. However, it is essential to utilize other techniques as well, in order to verify the results.},

It is a measure of developmental noise, which reflects a population's average state of adaptation and coadaptation. Moreover, it increases under both environmental and genetic stress, though responses are often inconsistent. Researchers base studies of fluctuating asymmetry upon deviations from bilateral, radial, rotational, dihedral, translational, helical, and fractal symmetries. Here, we review old and new methods of measuring fluctuating asymmetry, including measures of dispersion, landmark methods for shape asymmetry, and continuous symmetry measures. We also review the theory, developmental origins, and applications of fluctuating asymmetry, and attempt to explain conflicting results. In the process, we present examples from the literature, and from our own research at ``Evolution Canyon'' and elsewhere.},

  abstract = {"Applied Spatial Data Analysis with R, Second Edition, is divided into two basic parts, the first presenting R packages, functions, classes and methods for handling spatial data. This part is of interest to users who need to access and visualise spatial data. Data import and export for many file formats for spatial data are covered in detail, as is the interface between R and the open source GRASS GIS and the handling of spatio-temporal data. The second part showcases more specialised kinds of spatial data analysis, including spatial point pattern analysis, interpolation and geostatistics, areal data analysis and disease mapping. The coverage of methods of spatial data analysis ranges from standard techniques to new developments, and the examples used are largely taken from the spatial statistics literature. All the examples can be run using R contributed packages available from the CRAN website, with code and additional data sets from the book's own website. Compared to the first edition, the second edition covers the more systematic approach towards handling spatial data in R, as well as a number of important and widely used CRAN packages that have appeared since the first edition. This book will be of interest to researchers who intend to use R to handle, visualise, and analyse spatial data. It will also be of interest to spatial data analysts who do not use R, but who are interested in practical aspects of implementing software for spatial data analysis. It is a suitable companion book for introductory spatial statistics courses and for applied methods courses in a wide range of subjects using spatial data, including human and physical geography, geographical information science and geoinformatics, the environmental sciences, ecology, public health and disease control, economics, public administration and political science."--},

Furthermore, practical suggestions for the analysis and presentation of results, in prose, tables and/or figures, are included. Optional sections for each chapter include methodological extensions for readers desiring additional technical details. Rather than focus on mathematical calculations like so many other introductory texts in the behavioral sciences, the authors focus on conceptual explanations and the use of statistical computing. Statistical computing is an integral part of statistical work, and to support student learning in this area, examples using the R computer program are provided throughout the book. Rather than relegate examples to the end of chapters, the authors interweave computer examples with the narrative of the book. Topical coverage includes an introduction to R, data exploration of one variable, data exploration of multivariate data - comparing two groups and many groups, permutation and randomization tests, the independent samples t-Test, the Bootstrap test, interval estimates and effect sizes, power, and dependent samples"--},

  abstract = {A set of multivariate data can be expressed as a table, i.e., a matrix, of individuals (rows) by variables (columns), with the variables interrelated. Statistical procedures for analyzing such data sets are generally referred to as multivariate data analysis. The demand for this kind of analysis is increasing in a variety of fields. Each procedure in multivariate data analysis features a special purpose. For example, predicting future performance, classifying individuals, visualizing inter-individual relationships, finding a few factors underlying a number of variables, and examining causal relationships among variables are included in the purposes for the procedures. The aim of this book is to enable readers who may not be familiar with matrix operations to understand major multivariate data analysis procedures in matrix forms. For that aim, this book begins with explaining fundamental matrix calculations and the matrix expressions of elementary statistics, followed by an introduction to popular multivariate procedures, with chapter-by-chapter advances in the levels of matrix algebra. The organization of this book allows readers without knowledge of matrices to deepen their understanding of multivariate data analysis. Another feature of this book is its emphasis on the model that underlies each procedure and the objective function that is optimized for fitting the model to data. The author believes that the matrix-based learning of such models and objective functions is the shortest way to comprehend multivariate data analysis. This book is also arranged so that readers can intuitively capture for what purposes multivariate analysis procedures are utilized; plain explanations of the purposes with numerical examples precede mathematical descriptions in almost all chapters.},

The material presented here has been used by students of different levels and disciplines, including advanced undergraduates studying Mathematics and Statistics and students in graduate programs in Statistics, Biostatistics, Engineering, Economics, Marketing, Pharmacy, and Psychology. The goal of the book is to impart the basics of designing and carrying out Bayesian analyses, and interpreting and communicating the results. In addition, readers will learn to use the predominant software for Bayesian model-fitting, R and OpenBUGS. The practical approach this book takes will help students of all levels to build understanding of the concepts and procedures required to answer real questions by performing Bayesian analysis of real data. Topics covered include comparing and contrasting Bayesian and classical methods, specifying hierarchical models, and assessing Markov chain Monte Carlo output. --},

Focusing on the most standard statistical models and backed up by real datasets and an all-inclusive R (CRAN) package called bayess, the book provides an operational methodology for conducting Bayesian inference, rather than focusing on its theoretical and philosophical justifications. Readers are empowered to participate in the real-life data analysis situations depicted here from the beginning. The stakes are high and the reader determines the outcome. Special attention is paid to the derivation of prior distributions in each case and specific reference solutions are given for each of the models. Similarly, computational details are worked out to lead the reader towards an effective programming of the methods given in the book. In particular, all R codes are discussed with enough detail to make them readily understandable and expandable},

It offers reliable, hands-on coverage of the bootstrap's considerable advantages -- as well as its drawbacks. The book outpaces the competition by skillfully presenting results on improved confidence set estimation, estimation of error rates in discriminant analysis, and applications to a wide variety of hypothesis testing and estimation problems. To alert readers to the limitations of the method, the book exhibits counterexamples to the consistency of bootstrap methods. The authors take great care to draw connections between the more traditional resampling methods and the bootstrap, oftentimes displaying helpful computer routines in R. Emphasis throughout the book is on the use of the bootstrap as an exploratory tool including its value in variable selection and other modeling environments"--},

  abstract = {Objectives: Studies of osteoarthritis (OA) in human skeletal remains can come with scalar problems. If OA measurement is noted as present or absent in one joint, like the elbow, results may not identify specific articular pathology data and the sample size may be insufficient to address research questions. If calculated on a per data point basis (i.e., each articular surface within a joint), results may prove too data heavy to comprehensively understand arthritic changes, or one individual with multiple positive scores may skew results and violate the data independence required for statistical tests. The objective of this article is to show that the statistical methodology Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) can solve scalar issues in bioarchaeological studies.},

To complement the neuroscientist's toolbox, we present two powerful tools that can help us understand how groups of observations differ: the shift function and the difference asymmetry function. These tools can be combined with detailed visualisations to provide complementary perspectives about the data.

  abstract = {Hypothesis-testing methods for multivariate data are needed to make rigorous probability statements about the effects of factors and their interactions in experiments. Analysis of variance is particularly powerful for the analysis of univariate data. The traditional multivariate analogues, however, are too stringent in their assumptions for most ecological multivariate data sets. Non-parametric methods, based on permutation tests, are preferable. This paper describes a new non-parametric method for multivariate analysis of variance, after McArdle and Anderson (in press). It is given here, with several applications in ecology, to provide an alternative and perhaps more intuitive formulation for ANOVA (based on sums of squared distances) to complement the description provided by McArdle and Anderson (in press) for the analysis of any linear model. It is an improvement on previous non-parametric methods because it allows a direct additive partitioning of variation for complex models. It does this while maintaining the flexibility and lack of formal assumptions of other non-parametric methods. The teststatistic is a multivariate analogue to Fisher's F-ratio and is calculated directly from any symmetric distance or dissimilarity matrix. P-values are then obtained using permutations. Some examples of the method are given for tests involving several factors, including factorial and hierarchical (nested) designs and tests of interactions.},

Serra (1938) that included 256 individuals (131 females and 125 males) from the Coimbra Identified Skeletal Collection and 38 metric variables. The models for sex estimation were operationalized through an online application and decision support system, CADOES. Different classification algorithms generated high accuracy models, ranging from 85\% to 92\%, with only three variables; and from 85.33\% to 97.33\%, with all 38 variables. CADOES conveys a probabilistic prediction of skeletal sex, as well as a suite of attributes with educational applicability in the fields of human skeletal anatomy and statistics. This study upholds the value of the pelvis for the estimation of skeletal sex and provides models for that can be applied with high accuracy and low bias.},

  abstract = {One of the many areas in which correspondence analysis (CA) is an effective method, concerns seriation problems. For example, CA is a well-known technique for the seriation of archaeological assemblages. A problem with the CA seriation solution, however, is that only a relative ordering of the assemblages is obtained. To improve the usual CA solution, a constrained CA approach that incorporates additional information in the form of equality and inequality constraints concerning the time points of the assemblages may be considered. Using such constraints, explicit dates can be assigned to the seriation solution. The set of constraints that can be used in CA by introducing interval constraints is extended. That is, constraints that put the CA solution within a specific time frame. Moreover, the quality of the constrained CA solution is studied in a simulation study. In particular, by means of the simulation study we are able to assess how well ordinary, and constrained CA can recover the true time order. Furthermore, for the constrained approach, it is shown that the true dates are retrieved satisfactory. The simulation study is set up in such a way that it mimics the data of a series of ceramic assemblages consisting of the locally produced tableware from Sagalassos (SW Turkey). It is found that the dating of the assemblages on the basis of constraints appears to work quite well.},

Studies on hominin evolution and human biology have upended previous understandings by revealing more dynamic and context-dependent processes in our ancestry and phenotypic expressions.

Previous studies have documented greater right-biases in upper limb bone dimensionsdespecially in length and diaphyseal breadthdas well as more asymmetry in the upper limb when compared with the lower limb. Some studies have reported left-bias in lower limb bone dimensions, which, combined with the contralateral asymmetry in upper limbs, has been termed ``crossed symmetry.'' The examination of sexual dimorphism and population variation in asymmetry has been limited. This study re-examines these topics in a large, geographically and temporally diverse sample of 780 Holocene adult humans. Fourteen bilateral measures were taken, including maximum lengths, articular and peri-articular breadths, and diaphyseal breadths of the femur, tibia, humerus, and radius. Dimensions were converted into percentage directional (\%DA) and absolute (\%AA) asymmetries. Results reveal that average diaphyseal breadths in both the upper and lower limbs have the greatest absolute and directional asymmetry among all populations, with lower asymmetry evident in maximum lengths or articular dimensions. Upper limb bones demonstrate a systematic right-bias in all dimensions, while lower limb elements have biases closer to zero \%DA, but with slight left-bias in diaphyseal breadths and femoral length. Crossed symmetry exists within individuals between similar dimensions of the upper and lower limbs. Females have more asymmetric and right-biased upper limb maximum lengths, while males have greater humeral diaphyseal and head breadth \%DAs. The lower limb demonstrates little sexual dimorphism in asymmetry. Industrial groups exhibit relatively less asymmetry than pre-industrial humans and less dimorphism in asymmetry. A mixture of influences from both genetic and behavioral factors is implicated as the source of these patterns.},

  abstract = {The cross-sectional geometry (CSG) of long bone diaphyses is used in bioanthropology to evaluate their resistance to biomechanical constraints and to infer life-history-related patterns such as mobility, activity specialization or intensity, sexual dimorphism, body mass and proportions. First limited by technical analytical constraints to the analysis of one or two cross sections per bone, it has evolved into the analysis of cross sections of the full length of the diaphyseal part of long bones. More recently, researchers have developed analytical tools to map the cortical thickness of entire diaphyses to evaluate locomotor signatures. However, none of these analytical tools are easy to use for scientists who are not familiar with computer programming, and some statistical procedures\textendash{}such as mapping the correlation coefficients of the diaphyseal thickness with various parameters have yet to be made available. Therefore, we developed an automated and open-source application that renders those analyses (both CSG and cortical thickness) in a semiautomated and user friendly manner. This application, called ``Diaphysator'', is associated with another free software (``Extractor'', presented in Dupej et al. (). American Journal of Physical Anthropology, 164, 868\textendash{}876). Diaphysator can be used as an online application (https://diaphysator.shinyapps.io/maps) or as a package for R statistical software. Along with the mean maps of cortical thickness and mean CSG parameter graphs, the users can evaluate the correlations and partial correlations of both CSG parameters at every cross section along the diaphyseal length, and cortical thickness data points of the entire diaphysis, with any factor such as age, sex, stature, and body mass.},

The recommended changes include a wider consideration of the nature of the contribution than submitted manuscripts usually receive; a greater tolerance of ambiguity; more of an emphasis on the thinking and execution of the study, with a decreased emphasis on the findings; replacing NHST with the a priori procedure; and a call for reviewers and editors to recognize that there are many cases where the basic assumptions of inferential statistical procedures simply are not met, and that inferential statistics (even the a priori procedure) may consequently be inappropriate.},

Upon completion of this task, we then move on to deal with another core issue in the same way. We propose as the next project a process that might lead quickly to a strong consensus that the term ``statistically significant'' and all its cognates and symbolic adjuncts be disallowed in the scientific literature except where focus is on the history of statistics and its philosophies and methodologies.

  abstract = {Statistical inference often fails to replicate. One reason is that many results may be selected for drawing inference because some threshold of a statistic like the P-value was crossed, leading to biased reported effect sizes. Nonetheless, considerable non-replication is to be expected even without selective reporting, and generalizations from single studies are rarely if ever warranted. Honestly reported results must vary from replication to replication because of varying assumption violations and random variation; excessive agreement itself would suggest deeper problems, such as failure to publish results in conflict with group expectations or desires. A general perception of a ``replication crisis'' may thus reflect failure to recognize that statistical tests not only test hypotheses, but countless assumptions and the entire environment in which research takes place. Because of all the uncertain and unknown assumptions that underpin statistical inferences, we should treat inferential statistics as highly unstable local descriptions of relations between assumptions and data, rather than as providing generalizable inferences about hypotheses or models. And that means we should treat statistical results as being much more incomplete and uncertain than is currently the norm. Acknowledging this uncertainty could help reduce the allure of selective reporting: Since a small P-value could be large in a replication study, and a large P-value could be small, there is simply no need to selectively report studies based on statistical results. Rather than focusing our study reports on uncertain conclusions, we should thus focus on describing accurately how the study was conducted, what problems occurred, what data were obtained, what analysis methods were used and why, and what output those methods produced.},

The nature of exploratory work is that data are used to help guide model choice, and under these circumstances, uncertainty cannot be precisely quantified, because of the inevitable model selection bias that results. To be valid, statistical inference should be restricted to situations where the study design and analysis plan are specified prior to data collection. Exploratory data analysis provides the flexibility needed for most other situations, including statistical methods that are regularized, robust, or nonparametric. Of course, no individual statistical analysis should be considered sufficient to establish scientific validity: research requires many sets of data along many lines of evidence, with a watchfulness for systematic error.

We have no desire to ``ban'' p-values or other purely statistical measures.

If the alternative method is to have a chance of being adopted widely, it will have to be easy to understand and to calculate. One such proposal is based on calculation of false positive risk(FPR). It is suggested that p-values and confidence intervals should continue to be given, but that they should be supplemented by a single additional number that conveys the strength of the evidence better than the p-value. This number could be the minimum FPR (that calculated on the assumption of a prior probability of 0.5, the largest value that can be assumed in the absence of hard prior data). Alternatively one could specify the prior probability that it would be necessary to believe in order to achieve an FPR of, say, 0.05.},

  abstract = {Researchers commonly use p-values to answer the question: How strongly does the evidence favor the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis? p-Values themselves do not directly answer this question and are often misinterpreted in ways that lead to overstating the evidence against the null hypothesis. Even in the ``post p {$<$} 0.05 era,'' however, it is quite possible that p-values will continue to be widely reported and used to assess the strength of evidence (if for no other reason than the widespread availability and use of statistical software that routinely produces p-values and thereby implicitly advocates for their use). If so, the potential for misinterpretation will persist. In this article, we recommend three practices that would help researchers more accurately interpret p-values. Each of the three recommended practices involves interpreting p-values in light of their corresponding ``Bayes factor bound,'' which is the largest odds in favor of the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis that is consistent with the observed data. The Bayes factor bound generally indicates that a given p-value provides weaker evidence against the null hypothesis than typically assumed. We therefore believe that our recommendations can guard against some of the most harmful p-value misinterpretations. In research communities that are deeply attached to reliance on ``p {$<$} 0.05,'' our recommendations will serve as initial steps away from this attachment. We emphasize that our recommendations are intended merely as initial, temporary steps and that many further steps will need to be taken to reach the ultimate destination: a holistic interpretation of statistical evidence that fully conforms to the principles laid out in the ASA statement on statistical significance and p-values.},

  abstract = {When the editors of Basic and Applied Social Psychology effectively banned the use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) from articles published in their journal, it set off a fire-storm of discussions both supporting the decision and defending the utility of NHST in scientific research. At the heart of NHST is the p-value which is the probability of obtaining an effect equal to or more extreme than the one observed in the sample data, given the null hypothesis and other model assumptions. Although this is conceptually different from the probability of the null hypothesis being true, given the sample, p-values nonetheless can provide evidential information, toward making an inference about a parameter. Applying a 10,000-case simulation described in this article, the authors found that p-values' inferential signals to either reject or not reject a null hypothesis about the mean ({$\alpha$} = 0.05) were consistent for almost 70\% of the cases with the parameter's true location for the sampled-from population. Success increases if a hybrid decision criterion, minimum effect size plus p-value (MESP), is used. Here, rejecting the null also requires the difference of the observed statistic from the exact null to be meaningfully large or practically significant, in the researcher's judgment and experience. The simulation compares performances of several methods: from p-value and/or effect size-based, to confidence-interval based, under various conditions of true location of the mean, test power, and comparative sizes of the meaningful distance and population variability. For any inference procedure that outputs a binary indicator, like flagging whether a p-value is significant, the output of one single experiment is not sufficient evidence for a definitive conclusion. Yet, if a tool like MESP generates a relatively reliable signal and is used knowledgeably as part of a research process, it can provide useful information.},

Because the majority of spurious findings are small effects that are technically nonnull but practically indistinguishable from the null, the second-generation approach greatly reduces the likelihood of a false discovery. SGPVs promote transparency, rigor and reproducibility of scientific results by a priori identifying which candidate hypotheses are practically meaningful and by providing a more reliable statistical summary of when the data are compatible with the candidate hypotheses or null hypotheses, or when the data are inconclusive.

  abstract = {Stepwise regression building procedures are commonly used applied statistical tools, despite their well-known drawbacks. While many of their limitations have been widely discussed in the literature, other aspects of the use of individual statistical fit measures, especially in high-dimensional stepwise regression settings, have not. Giving primacy to individual fit, as is done with p-values and R2, when group fit may be the larger concern, can lead to misguided decision making. One of the most consequential uses of stepwise regression is in health care, where these tools allocate hundreds of billions of dollars to health plans enrolling individuals with different predicted health care costs. The main goal of this ``risk adjustment'' system is to convey incentives to health plans such that they provide health care services fairly, a component of which is not to discriminate in access or care for persons or groups likely to be expensive. We address some specific limitations of p-values and R2 for high-dimensional stepwise regression in this policy problem through an illustrated example by additionally considering a group-level fairness metric.},

The first and narrower is to formalize the p-value function, which records all possible p-values, each corresponding to a value for whatever the scalar parameter of interest is for the problem at hand, and to show how this p-value function directly provides full inference information for any corresponding user or scientist. The p-value function provides familiar inference objects: significance levels, confidence intervals, critical values for fixed-level tests, and the power function at all values of the parameter of interest. It thus gives an immediate accurate and visual summary of inference information for the parameter of interest. We show that the p-value function of the key scalar interest parameter records the statistical position of the observed data relative to that parameter, and we then describe an accurate approximation to that p-value function which is readily constructed.},

The bases for evaluating evidence are likelihood ratios and integrated likelihood ratios, computed under a variety of assumptions regarding the alternative hypotheses in null hypothesis significance tests. Likelihood ratios and integrated likelihood ratios provide a useful measure of the evidence in favor of competing hypotheses because they can be interpreted as representing the ratio of the probabilities that each hypothesis assigns to observed data. When they are either very large or very small, they suggest that one hypothesis is much better than the other in predicting observed data. If they are close to 1.0, then both hypotheses provide approximately equally valid explanations for observed data. I find that p-values that are close to 0.05 (i.e., that are ``marginally significant'') correspond to integrated likelihood ratios that are bounded by approximately 7 in two-sided tests, and by approximately 4 in one-sided tests.The modest magnitude of integrated likelihood ratios corresponding to p-values close to 0.05 clearly suggests that higher standards of evidence are needed to support claims of novel discoveries and new effects.},

The p-value and sample size jointly yield 95\% confidence bounds for the effect of interest, which can be compared to the predetermined meaningful effect size to make inferences about the true effect. I provide simple examples to demonstrate that although the p-value is calculated under the null hypothesis, and thus seemingly may be divorced from the features of the study from which it arises, its interpretation as a measure of evidence requires its contextualization within the study.

Fisher and his contemporaries formalized these methods in the early twentieth century and Fisher's 1925 Statistical Methods for Research Workers brought the techniques to experimentalists in a variety of disciplines. Understanding how these methods arose, spread, and were argued over since then illuminates how p {$<$} 0.05 came to be a standard for scientific inference, the advantage it offered at the time, and how it was interpreted. This historical perspective can inform the work of statisticians today by encouraging thoughtful consideration of how their work, including proposed alternatives to the p-value, will be perceived and used by scientists. And it can engage students more fully and encourage critical thinking rather than rote applications of formulae. Incorporating history enables students, practitioners, and statisticians to treat the discipline as an ongoing endeavor, crafted by fallible humans, and provides a deeper understanding of the subject and its consequences for science and society.},

This article proposes a ``straw man''solution which could be the basis of implementing these improvements. As part of this solution, we propose one way to ``bootstrap'' priors.

  abstract = {P values linked to null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is the most widely (mis)used method of statistical inference. Empirical data suggest that across the biomedical literature (1990\textendash{}2015), when abstracts use P values 96\% of them have P values of 0.05 or less. The same percentage (96\%) applies for full-text articles. Among 100 articles in PubMed, 55 report P values, while only 4 present confidence intervals for all the reported effect sizes, none use Bayesian methods and none use false-discovery rate. Over 25 years (1990\textendash{}2015), use of P values in abstracts has doubled for all PubMed, and tripled for meta-analyses, while for some types of designs such as randomized trials the majority of abstracts report P values. There is major selective reporting for P values. Abstracts tend to highlight most favorable P values and inferences use even further spin to reach exaggerated, unreliable conclusions. The availability of large-scale data on P values from many papers has allowed the development and applications of methods that try to detect and model selection biases, for example, p-hacking, that cause patterns of excess significance. Inferences need to be cautious as they depend on the assumptions made by these models and can be affected by the presence of other biases (e.g., confounding in observational studies). While much of the unreliability of past and present research is driven by small, underpowered studies, NHST with P values may be also particularly problematic in the era of overpowered big data. NHST and P values are optimal only in a minority of current research. Using a more stringent threshold, as in the recently proposed shift from P {$<$} 0.05 to P {$<$} 0.005, is a temporizing measure to contain the flood and death-by-significance. NHST and P values may be replaced in many fields by other, more fit-for-purpose, inferential methods. However, curtailing selection biases requires additional measures, beyond changes in inferential methods, and in particular reproducible research practices.},

This research investigates whether asymmetry of the humerus is present, if it is due to an individual's hand preference, and if this asymmetry can adversely affect the osteometric sorting method. The osteometric sorting formulae for pair-matching was used to classify individuals as asymmetric when elements were considered significantly different in size. Significant asymmetry was seen in multiple measurements and the asymmetry could be due to handedness. This relationship appeared more consistent with breadth measurements than length measurements. The epicondylar breadth of the humerus was the most asymmetric with 12.8\% of individuals considered asymmetric. Asymmetry of the maximum length of the humerus occurred in only 7.3\% of individuals. These results did not appear to correlate with the results seen on the radius since less than 50\% of the radii with asymmetry present were also asymmetrical at the level of the humerus. This indicates that asymmetry in the arm and forearm is not related. The measurements most likely related to handedness are discussed.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148\textendash{}156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

  abstract = {In addition to the pelvis, cranium and phalanges, the sternum is also used for postmortem sex identification. Bone measurements may be obtained on cadaveric bones. Alternatively, computerized tomography may be used to obtain measurements close to the original ones. Moreover, usage of artificial neural networks (ANNs) in the field of medicine has started to provide new horizons. In this study, we aimed to identify sex by an ANN using lengths of manubrium sterni (MSL), corpus sterni (CSL) and processus xiphoideus (XPL) and sternal angle (SA) from computerized tomography (CT) images brought to an orthogonal plane. This study used the thin-slice thoracic CT images of 422 cases (213 female, 209 male) with an age range of 27\textendash{}60 years brought to the orthogonal plane. Measurements of MSL, CSL, XPL and SA were analyzed with a multilayer artificial neural network that used stochastic gradient descent (SGD) for optimization and two hidden layers. MSL, CSL and XPL were longer, and SA was wider in men (MSL p\,=\,0.000, CSL p\,=\,0.000, XPL p\,=\,0.000, SA p\,=\,0.02). In the case of the two hidden layers of the network with 20 and 14 neurons in the hidden layers, respectively, learning rate of 0.1 and momentum coefficient of 0.9, the accuracy (Acc) of sex prediction was 0.906. In order to define a more realistic performance of the network, bootstrap was run with the confidence interval of 94\%. A sensitivity (Sen) value of 0.91 and a specificity (Spe) value of 0.90 were calculated. The success rates that were achieved in sex identification with measurements on the skeleton using ANN were observed to be higher than those achieved by linear models. Also, sometimes all parts of the bones may not be found or might be deformed. In this case, the number of parameters used for the estimation will be incomplete. The ANN has the strong advantage to be able to estimate despite the missing parameter.},

  abstract = {Age-at-death estimation in a skeletal assemblage (target sample) is biased by the demographic profile of the material used for age prediction (training sample) when this profile is different from that of the target sample. This bias is minimized if the demographic profile of the target sample is properly taken into account in the method developed for age-at-death estimation. In the Bayesian approach this is accomplished via the informative prior. For methods based on regression, we propose two techniques: (a) using weighting factors taken from the demographic profile of the target sample, and (b) creating a new hypothetical training sample that has a demographic profile similar to that of the target sample. The two techniques, as well as the Bayesian approach, were tested using 532 artificial systems in which the age marker exhibited an eight-grade expression. It was found that depending on the criteria used for evaluation, the proposed approaches and especially the one based on a hypothetical training sample, may give better results than the Bayesian method in more than 90\% of the systems studied. A basic prerequisite for the good performance of the proposed approaches is to select carefully the training sample. This sample should exhibit a uniform demographic profile or a profile with almost equal numbers of young and older individuals. All the above hold if the training and the target samples have different demographic profiles. If the profiles are the same or very similar, the best aging method is the direct regression using simple linear models.},

The analysis of artificial data and ordinal data expressing entheseal changes in archaeological North African populations gave the following results. Parametric and nonparametric tests give convergent results particularly for P values {$<$}0.1, irrespective of whether the underlying variable is normally distributed or not under the condition that the samples involved in the tests exhibit approximately equal sizes. If this prerequisite is valid and provided that the samples are of equal variances, analysis of covariance may be adopted. GLM are not subject to constraints and give results that converge to those obtained from all nonparametric tests. Therefore, they can be used instead of traditional tests as they give the same amount of information as them, but with the advantage of allowing the study of the simultaneous impact of multiple predictors and their interactions and the modeling of the experimental data. However, GLM should be replaced by GEE for the study of bilateral asymmetry and in general when paired samples are tested, because GEE are appropriate for correlated data.

This was accompanied by the IDADE2 software to facilitate calculations. However, the MS-DOS operating system on which the software was based became obsolete. The main goal of this article is to present the new IDADE2, which incorporates web-based facilities. Materials and methods The original IDADE2 has been re-written in R and presented as a web page. As in the original, this web page uses Bayesian inference to estimate age of unidentified individuals. The materials used to create the reference datasets of this web page include acetabular scores from documented skeletal samples from Spain (n = 24\venus{} and 52\male{}), Portugal (n = 317\venus{} and 294\male{}), and the US (n = 370\venus{} and 456\male{}). Results The IDADE2 website has eight sections. Six of these are informative to guide the user. The other two (Option 1 and Option 2) are dedicated to estimating age at death. Option 1 allows users to estimate the age of individual(s) in their test sample based on our reference data of acetabular scores. Option 2 allows users to estimate age from the acetabulum with their own reference and test collections or\textemdash{}if the users prefer\textemdash{}another age marker and method of choice.

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}ABSTRACT{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}To summarise skewed (asymmetric) distributions, such as reaction times, typically the mean or the median are used as measures of central tendency. Using the mean might seem surprising, given that it provides a poor measure of central tendency for skewed distributions, whereas the median provides a better indication of the location of the bulk of the observations. However, the sample median is biased: with small sample sizes, it tends to overestimate the population median. This is not the case for the mean. Based on this observation, Miller (1988) concluded that ``sample medians must not be used to compare reaction times across experimental conditions when there are unequal numbers of trials in the conditions.'' Here we replicate and extend Miller (1988), and demonstrate that his conclusion was ill-advised for several reasons. First, the median's bias can be corrected using a percentile bootstrap bias correction. Second, a careful examination of the sampling distributions reveals that the sample median is median unbiased, whereas the mean is median biased when dealing with skewed distributions. That is, on average the sample mean estimates the population mean, but typically this is not the case. In addition, simulations of false and true positives in various situations show that no method dominates. Crucially, neither the mean nor the median are sufficient or even necessary to compare skewed distributions. Different questions require different methods and it would be unwise to use the mean or the median in all situations. Better tools are available to get a deeper understanding of how distributions differ: we illustrate a powerful alternative that relies on quantile estimation.

This method is evaluated on a meta-population sample, where the data were acquired by direct observation of dry bones as well as computed tomography (CT) scans. A comparison with the original Bruzek's (2002) method is performed. Materials and methods Five hundred and ninety two ossa coxae of modern humans are included in the reference dataset. Two other samples, composed respectively of 518 ossa coxae and 99 CT-scan images, are both used for validation purposes. The individuals come from five European or North American population samples. Eleven trichotomic traits (expressing female, male, or intermediate forms) were observed on each os coxae. The new approach employs statistical processing based on logistic regressions. An R package freely available online, PELVIS, implements both methods. Results Both methods provide highly reliable sex estimates. The new statistical method has a slightly better accuracy rate (99.2\%) than the former method (98.2\%) but has also a higher rate of indeterminate individuals (12.9\% vs. 3\% for complete bones). Conclusion The efficiency of both methods is compared. Low error rates were preferred over high ability of reaching the classification threshold. The impact of lateralization and the asymmetry of observed traits are discussed. Finally, it is shown that this visual method of sex estimation is reliable and easy to use through the graphical user interface of the R package.},

We have generalized this coefficient by applying alternative functions of distance to produce more robust versions of the concordance correlation coefficient. In this paper we extend the application of this class of estimators to categorical data as well, and demonstrate similarities to the kappa and weighted kappa statistics. We also introduce a stratified concordance correlation coefficient which adjusts for explanatory factors, and an extended concordance correlation coefficient which measures agreement among more than two responses.

  abstract = {In any field in which decisions are subject to measurements, interchangeability between the methods used to obtain these measurements is essential. To consider methods as interchangeable, a certain degree of agreement is needed between the measurements they provide. The concordance correlation coefficient is an index that assesses the strength of agreement and it has been widely applied in situations in which measurements are made on a continuous scale. Recently the concordance correlation coefficient has been defined as a specific intraclass correlation coefficient estimated by the variance components of a Normal\textendash{}Normal mixed linear model. Although this coefficient was defined for the continuous scale case, it may also be used with a discrete scale. In this case the data are often transformed and normalized, and the concordance correlation is applied. This study discusses the expression of the concordance correlation coefficient for discrete Poisson data by means of the Poisson\textendash{}Normal generalized linear mixed model. The behaviour of the concordance correlation coefficient estimate is assessed by means of a simulation study, in which the estimates were compared using four models: three Normal\textendash{}Normal mixed models with raw data, log-transformed data and square-root transformed data, and the Poisson\textendash{}Normal generalized linear mixed model.

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to assess the relevance of computational anatomy for the sex determination in forensic anthropology. A novel groupwise registration algorithm is used, based on keypoint extraction, able to register several hundred full body images in a common space. Experiments were conducted on 83 CT scanners of living individuals from the public VISCERAL database. In our experiments, we first verified that the well-known criteria for sex discrimination on the hip-bone were well preserved in mean images. In a second experiment, we have tested semi-automatic positioning of anatomical landmarks to measure the relevance of groupwise registration for future research. We applied the Probabilistic Sex Diagnosis tool on the predicted landmarks. This resulted in 62\% of correct sex determinations, 37\% of undetermined cases, and 1\% of errors. The main limiting factors are the population sample size and the lack of precision for the initial manual positioning of the landmarks in the mean image. We also give insights on future works for robust and fully automatic sex determination.},

  abstract = {The minimum covariance determinant (MCD) method is a highly robust estimator of multivariate location and scatter, for which a fast algorithm is available. Since estimating the covariance matrix is the cornerstone of many multivariate statistical methods, the MCD is an important building block when developing robust multivariate techniques. It also serves as a convenient and efficient tool for outlier detection. The MCD estimator is reviewed, along with its main properties such as affine equivariance, breakdown value, and influence function. We discuss its computation, and list applications and extensions of the MCD in applied and methodological multivariate statistics. Two recent extensions of the MCD are described. The first one is a fast deterministic algorithm which inherits the robustness of the MCD while being almost affine equivariant. The second is tailored to high-dimensional data, possibly with more dimensions than cases, and incorporates regularization to prevent singular matrices.

Magnifying the bag by a factor 3 yields the ``fence'' (which is not plotted). Observations between the bag and the fence are marked by a light gray loop, whereas observations outside the fence are flagged as outliers. The bagplot visualizes the location, spread, correlation, skewness, and tails of the data. It is equivariant for linear transformations, and not limited to elliptical distributions. Software for drawing the bagplot is made available for the S-Plus and MATLAB environments.

  abstract = {The problem of testing outlying observations, although an old one, is of considerable importance in applied statistics. Many and various types of significance tests have been proposed by statisticians interested in this field of application. In this connection, we bring out in the Histrical Comments notable advances toward a clear formulation of the problem and important points which should be considered in attempting a complete solution. In Section 4 we state some of the situations the experimental statistician will very likely encounter in practice, these considerations being based on experience. For testing the significance of the largest observation in a sample of size nnn from a normal population, we propose the statistic S2nS2={$\sum$}n-1i=1(xi-x\textasciimacron{}n)2{$\sum$}ni=1(xi-x\textasciimacron{})2Sn2S2={$\sum$}i=1n-1(xi-x\textasciimacron{}n)2{$\sum$}i=1n(xi-x\textasciimacron{})2\textbackslash{}frac\{S\^2\_n\}\{S\^2\} = \textbackslash{}frac\{\textbackslash{}sum\^\{n-1\}\_\{i=1\} (x\_i - \textbackslash{}bar x\_n)\^2\}\{\textbackslash{}sum\^n\_\{i=1\} (x\_i - \textbackslash{}bar x)\^2\} where x1{$\leq$}x2{$\leq\cdots\leq$}xn,x\textasciimacron{}n=1n-1{$\sum$}n-1i=1xix1{$\leq$}x2{$\leq\cdots\leq$}xn,x\textasciimacron{}n=1n-1{$\sum$}i=1n-1xix\_1 \textbackslash{}leq x\_2 \textbackslash{}leq \textbackslash{}cdots \textbackslash{}leq x\_n, \textbackslash{}bar x\_n = \textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n - 1\} \textbackslash{}sum\^\{n-1\}\_\{i=1\} x\_i and x\textasciimacron{}=1n{$\sum$}ni=1xi.x\textasciimacron{}=1n{$\sum$}i=1nxi.\textbackslash{}bar x = \textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n\}\textbackslash{}sum\^\{n\}\_\{i=1\} x\_i. A similar statistic, S21/S2S12/S2S\^2\_1/S\^2, can be used for testing whether the smallest observation is too low. It turns out that S2nS2=1-1n-1(xn-x\textasciimacron{}s)2=1-1n-1T2n,Sn2S2=1-1n-1(xn-x\textasciimacron{}s)2=1-1n-1Tn2,\textbackslash{}frac\{S\^2\_n\}\{S\^2\} = 1 - \textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n - 1\} \textbackslash{}big(\textbackslash{}frac\{x\_n - \textbackslash{}bar x\}\{s\}\textbackslash{}big)\^2 = 1 - \textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n - 1\} T\^2\_n, where s2=1n{$\sigma$}(xi-x\textasciimacron{})2,s2=1n{$\sigma$}(xi-x\textasciimacron{})2,s\^2 = \textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n\}\textbackslash{}sigma(x\_i - \textbackslash{}bar x)\^2, and TnTnT\_n is the studentized extreme deviation already suggested by E. Pearson and C. Chandra Sekar [1] for testing the significance of the largest observation. Based on previous work by W. R. Thompson [12], Pearson and Chandra Sekar were able to obtain certain percentage points of TnTnT\_n without deriving the exact distribution of TnTnT\_n. The exact distribution of S2n/S2Sn2/S2S\^2\_n/S\^2 (or TnTnT\_n) is apparently derived for the first time by the present author. For testing whether the two largest observations are too large we propose the statistic S2n-1,nS2={$\sum$}n-2i=1(xi-x\textasciimacron{}n-1,n)2{$\sum$}ni=1(xi-x\textasciimacron{})2,x\textasciimacron{}n-1,n=1n-2{$\sum$}n-2i=1xiSn-1,n2S2={$\sum$}i=1n-2(xi-x\textasciimacron{}n-1,n)2{$\sum$}i=1n(xi-x\textasciimacron{})2,x\textasciimacron{}n-1,n=1n-2{$\sum$}i=1n-2xi\textbackslash{}frac\{S\^2\_\{n-1,n\}\}\{S\^2\} = \textbackslash{}frac\{\textbackslash{}sum\^\{n-2\}\_\{i=1\} (x\_i - \textbackslash{}bar x\_\{n-1,n\})\^2\}\{\textbackslash{}sum\^n\_\{i=1\} (x\_i - \textbackslash{}bar x)\^2\},\textbackslash{}quad\textbackslash{}bar x\_\{n-1,n\} = \textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n - 2\} \textbackslash{}sum\^\{n-2\}\_\{i=1\} x\_i and a similar statistic, S21,2/S2S1,22/S2S\^2\_\{1,2\}/S\^2, can be used to test the significance of the two smallest observations.

Although the efficiencies of the above tests have not been completely investigated under various models for outlying observations, it is apparent that the proposed sample criteria have considerable intuitive appeal. In deriving the distributions of the sample statistics for testing the largest (or smallest) or the two largest (or two smallest) observations, it was first necessary to derive the distribution of the difference between the extreme observation and the sample mean in terms of the population {$\sigma\sigma\backslash$}sigma. This probabilityX1{$\leq$}x2{$\leq$}x3{$\cdots\leq$}xnX1{$\leq$}x2{$\leq$}x3{$\cdots\leq$}xnX\_1 \textbackslash{}leq x\_2 \textbackslash{}leq x\_3 \textbackslash{}cdots \textbackslash{}leq x\_n s2=1n{$\sum$}ni=1(xi-x\textasciimacron{})2x\textasciimacron{}=1n{$\sum$}ni=1xis2=1n{$\sum$}i=1n(xi-x\textasciimacron{})2x\textasciimacron{}=1n{$\sum$}i=1nxis\^2 = \textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n\} \textbackslash{}sum\^n\_\{i=1\} (x\_i - \textbackslash{}bar x)\^2 \textbackslash{}quad \textbackslash{}bar x = \textbackslash{}frac\{1\}\{n\} \textbackslash{}sum\^n\_\{i=1\} x\_i distribution was apparently derived first by A. T. McKay [11] who employed the method of characteristic functions. The author was not aware of the work of McKay when the simplified derivation for the distribution of xn-x\textasciimacron{$\sigma$}xn-x\textasciimacron{$\sigma\backslash$}frac\{x\_n - \textbackslash{}bar x\}\{\textbackslash{}sigma\} outlined in Section 5 below was worked out by him in the spring of 1945, McKay's result being called to his attention by C. C. Craig. It has been noted also that K. R. Nair [20] worked out independently and published the same derivation of the distribution of the extreme minus the mean arrived at by the present author--see Biometrika, Vol. 35, May, 1948. We nevertheless include part of this derivation in Section 5 below as it was basic to the work in connection with the derivations given in Sections 8 and 9. Our table is considerably more extensive than Nair's table of the probability integral of the extreme deviation from the sample mean in normal samples, since Nair's table runs from n=2n=2n = 2 to n=9,n=9,n = 9, whereas our Table II is for n=2n=2n = 2 to n=25n=25n = 25. The present work is concluded with some examples.},

Currently it is once again an active research area after some years of relative neglect, and recent work has solved a number of old problems in outlier theory, and identified new ones. The major results are, however, scattered amongst many journal articles, and for some time there has been a clear need to bring them together in one place. That was the original intention of this monograph: but during execution it became clear that the existing theory of outliers was deficient in several areas, and so the monograph also contains a number of new results and conjectures. In view of the enormous volume ofliterature on the outlier problem and its cousins, no attempt has been made to make the coverage exhaustive. The material is concerned almost entirely with the use of outlier tests that are known (or may reasonably be expected) to be optimal in some way. Such topics as robust estimation are largely ignored, being covered more adequately in other sources. The numerous ad hoc statistics proposed in the early work on the grounds of intuitive appeal or computational simplicity also are not discussed in any detail.},

  abstract = {A look at the psychology literature reveals that researchers still seem to encounter difficulties in coping with multivariate outliers. Multivariate outliers can severely distort the estimation of population parameters. Detecting multivariate outliers is mainly disregarded or done by using the basic Mahalanobis distance. However, that indicator uses the multivariate sample mean and covariance matrix that are particularly sensitive to outliers. Hence, this method is problematic. We highlight the disadvantages of the basic Mahalanobis distance and argue instead in favor of a robust Mahalanobis distance. In particular, we present a variant based on the Minimum Covariance Determinant, a more robust procedure that is easy to implement. Using Monte Carlo simulations of bivariate sample distributions varying in size (ns=20, 100, 500) and population correlation coefficient ({$\rho$}=.10, .30, .50), we demonstrate the detrimental impact of outliers on parameter estimation and show the superiority of the MCD over the Mahalanobis distance. We also make recommendations for deciding whether to include vs. exclude outliers. Finally, we provide the procedures for calculating this indicator in R and SPSS software.},

It is not known whether the present catch of polar bears in the East Greenland subpopulation (EG) is sustainable. We used the Mean Measure of Divergence (MMD) to examine geographical variation in non-metrical traits from 1414 polar bear (Ursus maritimus) skulls collected in East Greenland (EG), Svalbard (SVA), Franz Josef Land (FJL), Davis Strait (DS), Baffin Bay (BB), and Kane Basin (KB), between 1830 and 2013. We focused on East Greenland with the goal of examining substructuring in the subpopulation. We did not find significant differences among samples across four areas of the EG subpopulation (i.e., offshore Fram Strait, NE, SE, and SW Greenland) using data from 1830 to 1983. Our analyses did not lend support to substructuring. However, we draw our conclusions with caution because skulls were sampled over a long time period and had low power due to small sample sizes. Also, comparisons were limited to pre-1980s skulls. The decrease in sea ice in EG since the 1990s due to climate change may have led to substructuring not detected with MMD. This study contributes to the current efforts by Greenland authorities to quantify connectivity of polar bears between southeast and northeast Greenland which is important information for the evaluation of the sustainability of the catch of bears from the EG subpopulation.},

In this chapter, we study approaches for predicting qualitative responses, a process that is known as classification. Predicting a qualitative response for an observation can be referred to as classifying that observation, since it involves assigning the observation to a category, or class. On the other hand, often the methods used for classification first predict the probability of each of the categories of a qualitative variable, as the basis for making the classification. In this sense they also behave like regression methods.},

  abstract = {Fluctuating asymmetry serves as an indicator of developmental homeostasis; any genetic or environmental factor that destroys homeostasis disturbs bilateral symmetry. Many studies have attempted to correlate increased fluctuating asymmetry with measures of developmental homeostasis or of adaptation, but collective results have been equivocal. We still have much to learn about fluctuating asymmetry itself. We develop a multivariate treatment of bilateral asymmetry that allows us to measure and adjust for the effects of both directional (right versus left) asymmetry and antisymmetry (handedness) and for the effects of size and sex. We examine 29 morphometric traits (13 size and shape, 8 pairs of bilateral traits) on 400 Israeli adults. We show that, even if metric traits are logarithmically transformed at the outset so that nonlinear allometric relations among them are properly accounted for and if the resulting measures are adjusted for sex by subtracting the means and dividing by the standard deviations, the correlation matrices among traits are strongly heterogeneous across sexes. Although the bilateral traits as a set are modestly correlated with the size and shape traits, neither size nor shape is correlated with asymmetry. Moreover, asymmetry traits are virtually uncorrelated inter se. We also examine the often touted connection between asymmetry and departures from morphometric modality and show that asymmetry is not correlated with deviations from either average size or average shape. If properly measured, fluctuating asymmetry becomes a measure of the noise in development; in our study it correlates with nothing. We discuss these results in light of empirical results and in terms of developmental theory suggesting that fluctuating asymmetry should be correlated with measures of maladaptation. Some of the effects reported in the literature need to be reexamined with more refined morphometric and statistical techniques.},

  abstract = {The unbiased estimation of fluctuating asymmetry (FA) requires independent repeated measurements on both sides. The statistical analysis of such data is currently performed by a two-way mixed ANOVA analysis. Although this approach produces unbiased estimates of FA, many studies do not utilize this method. This may be attributed in part to the fact that the complete analysis of FA is very cumbersome and cannot be performed automatically with standard statistical software. Therefore, further elaboration of the statistical tools to analyse FA should focus on the usefulness of the method, in order for the correct statistical approaches to be applied more regularly. In this paper we propose a mixed regression model with restricted maximum likelihood (REML) parameter estimation to model FA. This routine yields exactly the same estimates of FA as the two-way mixed ANOVA. Yet the advantages of this approach are that it allows (a) testing the statistical significance of FA, (b) modelling and testing heterogeneity in both FA and measurement error (ME) among samples, (c) testing for nonzero directional asymmetry and (d) obtaining unbiased estimates of individual FA levels. The switch from a mixed two-way ANOVA to a mixed regression model was made to avoid overparametrization. Two simulation studies are presented. The first shows that a previously proposed method to test the significance of FA is incorrect, contrary to our mixed regression approach. In the second simulation study we show that a traditionally applied measure of individual FA [abs(left \textendash{} right)] is biased by ME. The proposed mixed regression method, however, produces unbiased estimates of individual FA after modelling heterogeneity in ME. The applicability of this method is illustrated with two analyses.},

In addition, several other factors such as sexual dimorphism and variation in genetic backgrounds also influence lumbar vertebral morphology. Here we use 3D geometric morphometrics (GM) to analyze the 3D morphology of the lumbar spine in different human populations, exploring those potential causes of variation. Material and methods We collected 390 (semi) landmarks from 3D models of the CT scans of lumbar spines of seven males and nine females from a Mediterranean population (Spain, Israel) and seven males and either females from a South African population for geometric morphometric (GM) analysis. We carried out Generalized Procrustes Analysis, Principal Components, and Regression analyses to evaluate shape variation; and complemented these analyses with the Cobb Method. Results The Mediterranean sample was considerably more lordotic than the South African sample. In both populations, female lumbar spines showed proportionally narrower and more craniocaudally elongated lumbar segments than in males. In addition, the point of maximum curvature in females tended to be located more inferiorly than in males. Discussion Our results show that sexual dimorphism is an important factor of lumbar spine variation that mainly affects features of lumbar spine robustness (height proportions) and the structure\textemdash{}but not the degree\textemdash{}of its curvature. Differences in lordosis, however, are clearer at the inter-population level. This reflects previous conflicting studies casting doubts on pregnancy as an adaptive factor influencing lordosis. Other factors, for example, shape of the individual lumbar vertebrae and intervertebral discs and their relative proportions within the lumbar spine should be considered when exploring variation in vertebral column morphology.},

In material that is poorly preserved or very old, the tissue of choice is frequently tooth enamel, since this is less susceptible to diagenesis. The relationships between carbon isotope ratios in tooth enamel ({$\delta$}13Cenamel), bone collagen ({$\delta$}13Ccollagen), and bone apatite ({$\delta$}13Cbone apatite) are, however, not well understood. To elucidate these, we have measured all three indicators in archeological humans from the western and southern Cape coastal regions of South Africa. The correlation between {$\delta$}13Cenamel and {$\delta$}13Ccollagen is good (R2 = 0.71 if two outliers are excluded, n = 79). The correlation between {$\delta$}13Cenamel and {$\delta$}13Cbone apatite is weaker (R2= 0.37, n = 33) possibly due to bone diagenesis. No systematic offset between {$\delta$}13Cbone apatite and {$\delta$}13Cenamel was observed in this sample of archeological humans. Intertooth comparisons of {$\delta$}13Cenamel in three individuals showed little variation, despite the different ages of crown formation.

  abstract = {Empires have transformed political, social, and environmental landscapes in the past and present. Although much research on archaeological empires focuses on large-scale imperial processes, we use biogeochemistry and bioarchaeology to investigate how imperialism may have reshaped regional political organization and regional migration patterns in the Wari Empire of the Andean Middle Horizon (ca. AD 600\textendash{}1000). Radiogenic strontium isotope analysis of human remains from the site of Beringa in the Majes Valley of southern Peru identified the geographic origins of individuals impacted by the Wari Empire. At Beringa, the combined archaeological human enamel and bone values range from 87Sr/86Sr = 0.70802 - 0.70960, with a mean 87Sr/86Sr = 0.70842 {$\pm$} 0.00027 (1{$\sigma$}, n = 52). These data are consistent with radiogenic strontium isotope data from the local fauna in the Majes Valley and imply that most individuals were local inhabitants, rather than migrants from the Wari heartland or some other locale. There were two outliers at Beringa, and these ``non-local'' individuals may have derived from other parts of the South Central Andes. This is consistent with our understanding of expansive trade networks and population movement in the Andean Middle Horizon, likely influenced by the policies of the Wari Empire. Although not a Wari colony, the incorporation of small sites like Beringa into the vast social and political networks of the Middle Horizon resulted in small numbers of migrants at Beringa.

The 14th century AD was a tumultuous period of history in Britain, with severely erratic weather patterns, the Great Famine of 1315\textendash{}1322, the Scottish Wars of Independence, and the Hundred Years' War providing additional migration pressures to the ordinary economic issues drawing individuals to their capital under more stable conditions. East Smithfield Black Death Cemetery (Royal Mint) had a documented use period of only 2 years (AD 1348\textendash{}1350), providing a precise historical context ({$\sim$}50 years) for data. Adults (n = 30) from the East Smithfield site were sampled for strontium and oxygen stable isotope analyses of tooth enamel. Five individuals were demonstrated to be statistical outliers through the combined strontium and oxygen isotope data. Potential origins for migrants ranged from London's surrounding hinterlands to distant portions of northern and western Britain. Historic food sourcing practices for London were found to be an important factor for consideration in a broader than expected 87Sr/86Sr range reflected in a comparison of enamel samples from three London datasets. The pooled dataset demonstrated a high level of consistency between site data, divergent from the geologically predicted range. We argue that this supports the premise that isotope data in human populations must be approached as a complex interaction between behavior and environment and thus should be interpreted cautiously with the aid of alternate lines of evidence.

Material and Methods The SunWatch sample contains 166 individuals: 63 adults and 103 subadults. We analyze intracemetery biological variation using two feature sets: the buccolingual diameters of the polar teeth in the permanent (n = 37) and deciduous (n = 26) dentitions. We apply matrix correlation models to biodistance and grave distance matrices in both data sets, evaluate burial outliers and individuals exhibiting a rare dental feature with interindividual biological distances, and evaluate potential cultural subgroups with Mahalanobis' distance. Results Matrix correlation analyses for both feature sets as well as interindividual and subgroup distances indicate the SunWatch village cemetery was kin structured, contained a single primary biological population, and also contained a small number of non-local individuals most of whom were from closely related populations. We thus reject the hypothesis that the SunWatch population consisted of biologically distinct Late Woodland and Mississippian biological populations. Discussion Although SunWatch village exhibited cultural attributes characteristic of both local Late Woodland and non-local Mississippian groups, biologically the village was composed of one primary population. The lack of evidence for marked biological differentiation in the SunWatch village area at about 800\textendash{}500 BP. suggests diffusion and acculturation may account for Mississippian cultural characteristics in southwestern Ohio Fort Ancient villages. If gene flow or migrations from biologically distinct Mississippian populations into southwestern Ohio occurred, either or both likely occurred well before 800 BP. This would have allowed the process of admixture time to produce a relatively homogeneous, nondifferentiated population. The latter alternative is consistent with the appearance in southwestern Ohio of non-local individuals at one site linked to surrounding Mississippian regions at about 950 BP.

Carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios were analyzed in human bone samples from the Late Roman cemetery of Klettham and from the Early Medieval cemeteries of Altenerding and Straubing-Bajuwarenstrasse. For dietary comparison, samples of faunal bone from one Late Roman and three Early Medieval settlement sites were also analyzed. The results indicate that the average diet was in keeping with a landlocked environment and fairly limited availability of freshwater or marine resources. The diet appears not to have changed significantly from the Late Roman to the Early Medieval period. However, in the population of Altenerding, there were significant differences in the diet of men and women, supporting a hypothesis of greater mobility among women. Furthermore, the isotopic evidence from dietary outliers is supported by ``foreign'' grave goods and practices, such as artificial skull modification.

Here, we report an oxygen isotope study of humans and animals from coastal regions of Croatia in the Iron Age, Roman, and Early Medieval periods. The results show that while faunal values have little diachronic variation, the human data vary through time, and there are wide ranges of values within each period.

  abstract = {Objectives The nature of the agricultural transition in Southeast Asia has been a topic of some debate for archaeologists over the past decades. A prominent model, known as the two-layer hypothesis, states that indigenous hunter-gatherers were subsumed by the expansion of exotic Neolithic farmers into the area around 2000 BC. These farmers had ultimate origins in East Asia and brought rice and millet agriculture. Ban Non Wat is one of the few archaeological sites in Southeast Asia where this model can potentially be tested. The site is located in the Mun River valley of Northeast Thailand, and divided into 12 phases that span over 2,000 years, from about 1750 BC to the end of the Iron Age (ca. 500 AD). These phases exhibit successive cultural changes, and current interpretation of the site is of an early hunter-gatherer population, with agriculturalists immigrating into the later phases. Methods We analyzed strontium, oxygen, and carbon isotopes in tooth enamel from over 150 individuals, dating from the Neolithic to Iron Age, to assess extrinsic origins and differences in diet between early and later phases. Results We find evidence of dietary and cultural differences between groups at Ban Non Wat during its early occupation, but little evidence for immigration from distinct environments beyond the Khorat Plateau of Northeast Thailand. Conclusions The lack of consistent isotopic differences between early and later Neolithic occupants at Ban Non Wat means that the site does not conclusively support the two-layer hypothesis.

Archeological evidence suggests that both groups practised maize agriculture and pastoralism, but that their interaction zones differed significantly. Marine resources are common at Pica-Tarapac{\'a} sites, even those far from coast, while Atacama sites in the desert oases and precordilleran area seem to have directed their networks towards the highlands. Here we apply stable carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen isotope analysis on human bone and enamel to test dietary patterns and residential mobility at two sites, Pica 8 and Quitor 6, representing the Pica-Tarapac{\'a} and Atacama cultures, respectively. Our results show that diet at the two sites indeed differed: significant but variable consumption of marine resources and maize is indicated at Pica 8, despite being an inland site, while diet at Quitor 6 was based mainly on terrestrial resources. The use of seabird guano and llama dung as fertilizers and extreme aridity may have contributed to the high nitrogen isotope values observed in Pica 8 humans. The {$\delta$}18O values in Pica 8 individuals are generally lower than for Quitor in spite of its greater distance from the Andes. All three isotopes suggest the presence of at least five nonlocals in the 30 measured at Pica 8. This evidence for human mobility is consistent with the high levels of trade and interaction observed in the archeological record, and begins to quantify the degree of movement of specific individuals.

  abstract = {Warfare impacts how people and populations can move about the landscape. Ethnographers have posited that internal warfare, conflict that takes place within a single society, is strongly associated with female abduction. In contrast, external warfare, combat between different societies, is often accompanied by the in-migration of men for purposes of defence. To test this assertion, we evaluate human remains from one of the most violent eras in Andean prehistory, the Late Intermediate Period (ad 1000\textendash{}1400). In the south-central highlands of Andahuaylas, Peru, this era witnessed the coalescence of two formidable polities, the Chanka and the Quichua. Ethnohistoric accounts describe internal warfare among the Chanka and external warfare between the Quichua and their neighbours. In this study, bioarchaeological and biogeochemical methods are marshalled to elucidate ancient patterns of violence and mobility with greater nuance. We employ strontium isotope analysis of tooth enamel apatite to inform on residential origin, and we reconstruct patterns of violent conflict through analysis of cranial trauma. In all, 265 crania were excavated from 17 cave ossuaries at two Chanka sites and one Quichua site. Data were collected on age, sex and cranial modification\textemdash{}an indicator of social identity and cranial trauma. A representative subsample of molars from 34 individuals subjected to strontium isotope analysis demonstrates that among the Chanka, violence was significantly directed towards social groups within society, marked by modified crania. The presence of two nonlocal women with signs of increased morbidity and mistreatment points to possible mobility-by-abduction. In contrast, among the Quichua, men have significantly more trauma, and wounds are concentrated on the anterior. Trauma on women is lower, nonlethal, and concentrated on the posterior. This divergent pattern is commonly observed in external warfare (raids and community defence), where men face attackers and women escape them. The presence of two nonlocal men supports a mobility model of strategic in-migration. In sum, osteological and isotopic data sets are shown to reveal divergent life-course experiences not captured by the archaeological data or historic records alone.

  abstract = {Stable strontium isotopes have been used to identify the skeletons of migrants in several recent archaeological studies, in which local 87Sr/86Sr values have been inferred through statistical parameters of human 87Sr/86Sr data, or by reference to local fauna or other environmental samples. This paper compares these approaches using data from the ancient Maya city of Tikal, Guatemala. The skeletons of eight migrants from distant geological zones are readily apparent among the 83 Tikal skeletons sampled. Three additional non-local skeletons can be eliminated to obtain a normally distributed ``local'' Tikal sample. The mean of this sample is higher than the available data for local fauna and for lime that may have been used to treat maize at Tikal. It is possible that imported sea salt with a high 87Sr/86Sr ratio could account for this elevated mean for Tikal humans. Modeling demonstrates that dietary 87Sr/86Sr may be raised to the level found at Tikal by a daily intake of only 6 g of sea salt.},

  abstract = {In this study, we used oxygen- and hydrogen-isotope data from human bone ({$\delta$}18O) and modern environmental water samples ({$\delta$}18O and {$\delta$}D) to investigate geographic origins of individuals buried at Cahuachi, a ceremonial centre in the Nasca region of Peru (c.AD1-1000). Our objective was to characterise the natural variation in water stable isotopic composition in the Rio Grande de Nasca drainage, and then to use these data to better infer place of origin for 30 adults interred at Cahuachi. Using the {$\delta$}18O and {$\delta$}D values of 63 modern environmental water samples, it was possible to differentiate among the northern and southern river middle valleys, and to infer the isotopic composition of drinking water at higher elevations. Over half of the individuals included in this study had drinking water oxygen-isotope compositions consistent with places of origin away from Cahuachi during the last 10 to 25 years of life, perhaps in the northern river middle valleys or in the upper valleys/sierra. The environmental water stable isotopic baseline developed in this study enabled a better understanding of the natural variation of waters in the Rio Grande de Nasca drainage. As a result, it was possible to assess the geographic range of place of origin for these individuals with greater certainty. Taken together, these data support the idea of Cahuachi as a place of both local and regional significance, with individuals from distant parts of the Rio Grande de Nasca drainage travelling to and/or transporting the dead to the site for death or burial.

It tests the applicability of the probabilistic clustering methods commonly used in human population genetics for the analysis of continuous, cranial measurement data, to improve population inference for admixed individuals without prior knowledge of sample origins. Materials and Methods The unsupervised model-based clustering methods of finite mixture analysis are used here to reveal latent population structure and generate admixture proportions for craniofacial measurements from the Forensic Anthropology Data Bank (FDB). Craniometric estimates of ancestry are also generated under a three contributor model, sourcing parental reference populations from the Howells Craniometric Dataset. Tests of association are made among the coefficients of cluster memberships and the demographic information documented for each individual in the FDB. Clustering results are contextualized within the framework of conventional approaches to population structure analysis and individual ancestry estimation to discuss method compatibility. Results The findings reported here for contemporary American craniometrics are in agreement with the expected patterns of intergroup relationships, geographic origins and results from published genetic analyses. Discussion Population inference methods that allow for the model-bound estimation of admixture and ancestry proportions from craniometric data not only enable parallel\textemdash{}skeletal and genetic\textemdash{}analyses but they are also shown to be more informative than those methods that perform hard classifications using externally-imposed categories or seek to explain gross variation by low-dimensional projections.

Casts of permanent second mandibular molars are examined with a scanning electron microscope at a magnification of 500\texttimes. Digitized micrographs are taken from the upper and lower part of facet nine. Microwear patterns are recorded with an image-analysis computer program and compared within and between samples, using univariate and multivariate analyses. Comparisons within samples reveal a greater frequency of pits on the lower part of the facet among the farmers, compared to the upper part. Microwear does not vary over the facet among the hunter-gatherers. Comparisons between samples reveal larger dental pits (length and width) and wider scratches among the farmers at the bottom of the facet, compared to the hunter-gatherers. Microwear does not vary between samples at the top of the facet. The microwear patterns suggest that the Natufian to early Neolithic development led to a harder diet, and this is related to an archaeologically suggested change in food processing. The harder diet of the early farmers may have required higher bite forces that were exerted at the bottom of facet nine, in the basin of the tooth.

Analysis discloses significant sex dimorphism in the strengths of the intercorrelations, with females being better integrated. Principal components analysis (PCA) provides an objective means of data reduction (shown here to be preferable to simple size summation methods) and decorrelation of the resulting linear combinations. Four components are extracted (with results being virtually identical in the two sexes) and arguments are put forth that varimax rotation to ``a simpler solution'' may be counterproductive. Before rotation, the four components are 1) overall size, 2) buccolingual widths contrasted with mesiodistal lengths, 3) anterior (I,C) contrasted with posterior (P,M) teeth, and 4) premolars contrasted with molars. Most of the explained (shared) variance (63\%) extracted by PCA is in overall size of the dentition. There is a strong urge to view the results of these principal components analyses as reflective of biologically and genetically meaningful entities.},

  abstract = {We propose a generic method for the statistical analysis of collections of anatomical shape complexes, namely sets of surfaces that were previously segmented and labeled in a group of subjects. The method estimates an anatomical model, the template complex, that is representative of the population under study. Its shape reflects anatomical invariants within the dataset. In addition, the method automatically places control points near the most variable parts of the template complex. Vectors attached to these points are parameters of deformations of the ambient 3D space. These deformations warp the template to each subject's complex in a way that preserves the organization of the anatomical structures. Multivariate statistical analysis is applied to these deformation parameters to test for group differences. Results of the statistical analysis are then expressed in terms of deformation patterns of the template complex, and can be visualized and interpreted. The user needs only to specify the topology of the template complex and the number of control points. The method then automatically estimates the shape of the template complex, the optimal position of control points and deformation parameters. The proposed approach is completely generic with respect to any type of application and well adapted to efficient use in clinical studies, in that it does not require point correspondence across surfaces and is robust to mesh imperfections such as holes, spikes, inconsistent orientation or irregular meshing.},

  abstract = {This paper aims at quantifying ontogenetic differences between bonobo (Pan paniscus) and chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) endocrania, using dental development as a timeline. We utilize a methodology based on smooth and invertible deformations combined with a metric of ``currents'' that defines a distance between endocranial surfaces and does not rely on correspondence between landmarks. This allows us to perform a temporal surface regression that estimates typical endocranial ontogenetic trajectories separately for bonobos and chimpanzees. We highlight non-linear patterns of endocranial ontogenetic change and significant differences between species at local anatomical levels rather than considering the endocranium as a uniform entity. A spatiotemporal registration permits the quantification of interspecies differences decomposed into a morphological deformation (accounting for size and shape differences independently of age) and a time warp (accounting for changes in the dynamics of development). Our statistical simulations suggest that patterns of endocranial volume (EV) increase may differ significantly between bonobos and chimpanzees, with an earlier phase of a relatively rapid increase (preferentially at some endocranial subdivisions) in the former and a much later phase of relatively rapid increase in the latter. As a consequence, the chimpanzee endocranium appears to reach its adult size later. Moreover, the time warp indicates that juvenile bonobos develop much slower than juvenile chimpanzees, suggesting that inter-specific ontogenetic shifts do not only concern EV increase, but also the rate of shape changes over time. Our method provides, for the first time, a quantitative estimation of inter-specific ontogenetic shifts that appear to differentiate non-linearly.},

  abstract = {Statistical analysis of shapes, performed by constructing an atlas composed of an average model of shapes within a population and associated deformation maps, is a fundamental aspect of medical imaging studies. Usual methods for constructing a shape atlas require point correspondences across subjects, which are difficult in practice. By contrast, methods based on currents do not require correspondence. However, existing atlas construction methods using currents suffer from two limitations. First, the template current is not in the form of a topologically correct mesh, which makes direct analysis on shapes difficult. Second, the deformations are parametrized by vectors at the same location as the normals of the template current which often provides a parametrization that is more dense than required. In this paper, we propose a novel method for constructing shape atlases using currents where topology of the template is preserved and deformation parameters are optimized independently of the shape parameters. We use an L1-type prior that enables us to adaptively compute sparse and low dimensional parameterization of deformations. We show an application of our method for comparing anatomical shapes of patients with Down's syndrome and healthy controls, where the sparse parametrization of diffeomorphisms decreases the parameter dimension by one order of magnitude.},

Evolutionary trends in multivariate phenotypes are derived from distances and directions between species in a multivariate phenotype space.

Visualizing such trends, as is achieved with phylomorphospaces, should continue to play a prominent role in macroevolutionary analyses. Evaluating phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) models (e.g., phylogenetic analysis of variance and regression) is valuable, but using parametric procedures is limited to only a few phenotypic variables. In contrast, nonparametric, permutation-based PGLS methods provide a flexible alternative and are thus preferred for highdimensional multivariate phenotypes. Permutation-based methods for evaluating covariation within multivariate phenotypes are also well established and can test evolutionary trends in phenotypic integration. However, comparing evolutionary rates and modes in multivariate phenotypes remains an important area of future development.},

  abstract = {{$<$}h3{$>$}Abstract{$<$}/h3{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}Using sampling experiments, we found that, when there are fewer groups than variables, between-groups PCA (bgPCA) may suggest surprisingly distinct differences among groups for data in which none exist. While apparently not noticed before, the reasons for this problem are easy to understand. A bgPCA captures the \emph{g}-1 dimensions of variation among the \emph{g} group means, but only a fraction of the dimensions of within-group variation (\emph{n\textsubscript{i}} are the sample sizes), when the number of variables, \emph{p}, are greater than \emph{g}-1. This introduces a distortion in the appearance of the bgPCA plots because the within-group variation will be underrepresented, unless the variables are sufficiently correlated so that the total variation can be accounted for with just \emph{g}-1 dimensions. The effect is most obvious when sample sizes are small relative to the number of variables, because smaller samples spread out less, but the distortion is present even for large samples. Strong covariance among variables largely reduces the magnitude of the problem, because it effectively reduces the dimensionality of the data and thus enables a larger proportion of the within-group variation to be accounted for within the \emph{g}-1-dimensional space of a bgPCA. The distortion will still be relevant though its strength will vary from case to case depending on the structure of the data (\emph{p}, \emph{g}, covariances etc.). These are important problems for a method developed mainly to analyze variation among groups when there are very large numbers of variables and relatively small samples, a common situation in fields ranging from morphometrics (as in our examples) to molecular analyses.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

One hundred forty-seven human and 47 domestic faunal samples were successfully analysed with the objective of defining agrarian productive strategies and food consumption patterns. The results grouped the five sites in two clusters: on one side Zaballa and Trevi{\~n}o, whose inhabitants followed diets exclusively based on C3 plants with significant intake of animal protein, and on the other, the populations from Aistra and Zornoztegi, who combined C3 and C4 plants and consumed lower amounts of animal protein. The isotopic values from Dulantzi were intermediate to these two groups. No differences were detected when individual status markers, such as grave goods, were available. Conversely, some restrictions on the access to certain food resources based on sex were uncovered. A relevant change in {$\delta$}13C values was identified around 10th century, a consequence of a shift in the consumption patterns of C3 and C4 plants. Finally, these Basque sites were compared with those of the medieval Iberian case studies available in the literature.

We examine the diet of white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus imitator) to determine: (a) timing and types of invertebrate food consumption; (b) whether invertebrate consumption varies with availability of plant foods; and (c) how invertebrates contribute to energy and protein intake of females during different reproductive states. Materials and methods We analyze 2 years of behavioral data from 25 adult female capuchins to determine which invertebrates are eaten. We describe annual and monthly invertebrate consumption patterns, and, employing circular statistics, analyze seasonal consumption of the four most important invertebrate groups eaten. We apply logistic regression analyses to tree density and fruit energy data to determine whether capuchin invertebrate foraging is related to fruit energy availability of their most commonly consumed fruits. We evaluate the nutritional contribution of invertebrates to energetic and protein requirements of females over time and across reproductive stages. Results Capuchins consumed invertebrates from 21 identifiable groups, but their diet was dominated by four orders: Lepidoptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and Hymenoptera. All four orders were consumed in a significantly seasonal pattern, and reduced fruit energy availability was a significant predictor of increased invertebrate foraging. Capuchin females often required invertebrate energy intake to meet their overall monthly energetic needs, particularly while they were lactating, even though they appear to exceed their protein requirements every month. Discussion These results indicate that invertebrate consumption is critical for capuchin energetic needs, particularly during periods of reduced fruit availability and lactation.},

  abstract = {Oxygen isotope analysis of archaeological skeletal remains is an increasingly popular tool to study past human migrations. It is based on the assumption that human body chemistry preserves the {$\delta$}18O of precipitation in such a way as to be a useful technique for identifying migrants and, potentially, their homelands. In this study, the first such global survey, we draw on published human tooth enamel and bone bioapatite data to explore the validity of using oxygen isotope analyses to identify migrants in the archaeological record. We use human {$\delta$}18O results to show that there are large variations in human oxygen isotope values within a population sample. This may relate to physiological factors influencing the preservation of the primary isotope signal, or due to human activities (such as brewing, boiling, stewing, differential access to water sources and so on) causing variation in ingested water and food isotope values. We compare the number of outliers identified using various statistical methods. We determine that the most appropriate method for identifying migrants is dependent on the data but is likely to be the IQR or median absolute deviation from the median under most archaeological circumstances. Finally, through a spatial assessment of the dataset, we show that the degree of overlap in human isotope values from different locations across Europe is such that identifying individuals' homelands on the basis of oxygen isotope analysis alone is not possible for the regions analysed to date. Oxygen isotope analysis is a valid method for identifying first-generation migrants from an archaeological site when used appropriately, however it is difficult to identify migrants using statistical methods for a sample size of less than c. 25 individuals. In the absence of local previous analyses, each sample should be treated as an individual dataset and statistical techniques can be used to identify migrants, but in most cases pinpointing a specific homeland should not be attempted.},

Yet, the mobility of one the most obvious sources of social and economic wealth in the Bronze Age has got little attention: livestock. This study explores the possible social role of livestock of cattle and sheep, both in the household sphere and in the sphere of exchange as a means of `connecting people'. Here, strontium isotope data are presented from 58 cattle and sheep from settlement contexts from Bronze Age West-Frisia (2000\textendash{}800 BCE), the Netherlands, with the aim to gain an isotopic perspective on the socio-economic significance of livestock. The data provide evidence for long-distance trade or exchange of livestock. Besides their monetary value, we suggest that livestock, and in particular cattle, may have been perceived as equal to people in terms of labour and production and as members of the household. Their mobility and exchange therefore signal more than just economic trade, it signals a social practice. By changing our perspective towards the social ideology of farming life, we will move closer to understanding Bronze Age societies in more diverse and inclusive ways. Research into livestock mobility is therefore considered fundamental for a more diverse understanding of Bronze Age farming life.},

Statistically significant differences between {$\delta$}15N and {$\delta$}34S values from the St Barbara cemetery in the hanseatic town of Tallinn (Reval) and the rural village cemetery of Kaberla suggest that there were likely real differences between urban and rural diets, either in terms of access to certain types of foods or due to different practices regarding farming and food production. While diet at both locations was likely dominated by C3 terrestrial resources, relatively high {$\delta$}15N values suggest a significant reliance on higher trophic level protein (including fish). However, because of brackish conditions prevalent in the Baltic Sea, local marine, freshwater and terrestrial {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}34S isotopic ranges in coastal northern Estonia may not be distinct enough to allow for a more detailed palaeodietary reconstruction.},

  abstract = {The diet of the population interred at the Islamic necropolis of Can Fonoll, Ibiza, Spain, which was in use between the 10th and 13th centuries AD, is reconstructed from the carbon ({$\delta$}13C) and nitrogen ({$\delta$}15N) stable isotope ratios of bone collagen from 112 individuals. The mean{$\pm$}sd (1{$\sigma$}) {$\delta$}13C (-19.0{$\pm$}1.3\textperthousand{}) and {$\delta$}15N (10.3{$\pm$}0.8\textperthousand{}) values of the Can Fonoll population indicate a diet based largely on terrestrial C3 resources. However, the wide range of both {$\delta$}13C (-20.6\textperthousand{} to -8.6\textperthousand{}) and {$\delta$}15N (7.0\textperthousand{} to 12.1\textperthousand{}) values attested at Can Fonoll indicate significant variation in individual diet. The elevated {$\delta$}13C values of a small proportion of the individuals buried at Can Fonoll are consistent with the consumption of a large proportion of, or dependence on, C4 resources, such as millet. Comparison of the {$\delta$}13C and {$\delta$}15N values of the Can Fonoll population with those of other mediaeval populations from the Balearic Islands and mainland Spain highlights a wide range of stable isotope values, which reflects not only significant differences in diet but also points to widespread mobility within the Mediterranean Basin.},

For this one usually takes the median absolute deviation MAD n = 1.4826 med, |xi - med j x j |, because it has a simple explicit formula, needs little computation time, and is very robust as witnessed by its bounded influence function and its 50\% breakdown point. But there is still room for improvement in two areas: the fact that MAD n is aimed at symmetric distributions and its low (37\%) Gaussian efficiency. In this article we set out to construct explicit and 50\% breakdown scale estimators that are more efficient. We consider the estimator Sn = 1.1926 med, med j | xi - xj | and the estimator Qn given by the .25 quantile of the distances |xi - x j |; i {$<$} j. Note that Sn and Qn do not need any location estimate. Both Sn and Qn can be computed using O(n log n) time and O(n) storage. The Gaussian efficiency of Sn is 58\%, whereas Qn attains 82\%. We study Sn and Qn by means of their influence functions, their bias curves (for implosion as well as explosion), and their finite-sample performance. Their behavior is also compared at non-Gaussian models, including the negative exponential model where Sn has a lower gross-error sensitivity than the MAD.},

  abstract = {Studies of directional asymmetry in the human upper limb have extensively examined bones of the arm, forearm, and hand, but have rarely considered the clavicle. Physiologically, the clavicle is an integrated element of the upper limb, transmitting loads to the axial skeleton and supporting the distal bones. However, clavicles develop in a manner that is unique among the bones of the upper limb. Previous studies have indicated that the clavicle has a right-biased asymmetry in diaphyseal breadth, as in humeri, radii, ulnae, and metacarpals, but unlike these other elements, a left-biased length asymmetry. Few studies have assessed how clavicular asymmetry relates to these other bones of the upper limb. Bilateral directional asymmetry of the clavicle is examined in relation to the humerus in a large, geographically diverse human sample, comparing lengths and diaphyseal breadths. Dimensions were converted into percentage directional (\%DA) and absolute (\%AA) asymmetries. Results indicate that humans have same-side \%DA bias in the clavicles and humeri, and contralateral length \%DA between these elements. Diaphyseal breadths in both clavicles and humeri are more asymmetric\textemdash{}both in direction and amount\textemdash{}than lengths. Differences in diaphyseal asymmetry are shown to relate to variation in physical activities among groups, but a relationship between activity and length asymmetry is not supported. This further supports previous research, which suggests different degrees of sensitivity to loading between diaphyseal breadths and maximum lengths of long bones. Differences in lateralized behavior and the potential effects of different bone development are examined as possible influences on the patterns observed among human groups.},

California Amerind males were also more asymmetrical than British Columbian Amerind males who rowed (using both arms) extensively. Sex differences within British Columbian Amerinds were not statistically significant, nor were female differences between populations.

In this paper we aim to improve research practices by outlining what you need to know about outliers. We start by providing a functional definition of outliers. We then lay down an appropriate nomenclature/classification of outliers.~This nomenclature is used to understand what kinds of outliers can be encountered and serves as a guideline to make appropriate decisions regarding the conservation, deletion, or recoding of outliers. These decisions might impact the validity of statistical inferences as well as the reproducibility of our experiments. To be able to make informed decisions about outliers you first need proper detection tools. We remind readers why the most common outlier detection methods are problematic and recommend the use of the median absolute deviation to detect univariate outliers, and of the Mahalanobis-MCD distance to detect multivariate outliers. An R package was created that can be used to easily perform these detection tests. Finally, we promote the use of pre-registration to avoid flexibility in data analysis when handling outliers.

An adjustment of the boxplot is presented that includes a robust measure of skewness in the determination of the whiskers. This results in a more accurate representation of the data and of possible outliers. Consequently, this adjusted boxplot can also be used as a fast and automatic outlier detection tool without making any parametric assumption about the distribution of the bulk of the data.

  title = {Estimating the Sample Mean and Standard Deviation from the Sample Size, Median, Range and/or Interquartile Range},
  volume = {14},
  issn = {1471-2288},
  abstract = {Background
In systematic reviews and meta-analysis, researchers often pool the results of the sample mean and standard deviation from a set of similar clinical trials. A number of the trials, however, reported the study using the median, the minimum and maximum values, and/or the first and third quartiles. Hence, in order to combine results, one may have to estimate the sample mean and standard deviation for such trials.

Methods
In this paper, we propose to improve the existing literature in several directions. First, we show that the sample standard deviation estimation in Hozo et al.'s method (BMC Med Res Methodol 5:13, 2005) has some serious limitations and is always less satisfactory in practice. Inspired by this, we propose a new estimation method by incorporating the sample size. Second, we systematically study the sample mean and standard deviation estimation problem under several other interesting settings where the interquartile range is also available for the trials.

Results
We demonstrate the performance of the proposed methods through simulation studies for the three frequently encountered scenarios, respectively. For the first two scenarios, our method greatly improves existing methods and provides a nearly unbiased estimate of the true sample standard deviation for normal data and a slightly biased estimate for skewed data. For the third scenario, our method still performs very well for both normal data and skewed data. Furthermore, we compare the estimators of the sample mean and standard deviation under all three scenarios and present some suggestions on which scenario is preferred in real-world applications.

Conclusions
In this paper, we discuss different approximation methods in the estimation of the sample mean and standard deviation and propose some new estimation methods to improve the existing literature. We conclude our work with a summary table (an Excel spread sheet including all formulas) that serves as a comprehensive guidance for performing meta-analysis in different situations.

In spite of being the focus of intensive research over the years, the biological status and origins of the herders are still unclear. Did they represent a genetically distinct immigrant population who remained separate from the indigenous hunter\textendash{}gatherers, or where they indigenous hunter\textendash{}gatherers who took up herding after contact with herders, probably in northern Botswana? Here, this issue is investigated using craniometric data collected on a large sample of individually dated human crania from coastal LSA context. Mahalanobis distances (D), calculated from the raw metric data, show that there was a small increase in inter-individual craniofacial variation after the introduction of herding at ca. 2000 BP. Here it is argued that this small increase in variation is neither consistent with a large-scale immigration of genetically distinct herders into South Africa, or the long-term co-existence of two genetically distinct populations. Two alternative explanations fit the data better: (1) herding entered South Africa via the small-scale immigration of genetically distinct herders; and (2) local hunter\textendash{}gatherer populations adopted herding after coming in contact with herders in northern Botswana. While small-scale immigration would not have had a major influence on the local gene pool, it would have increased variation to some extent as immigrants mixed with local populations. If small-scale external gene flow was not a factor in the introduction of herding, secular issues related to the introduction of herding could explain the increased variation in post-2000 BP populations.},

  abstract = {Clustering algorithms are attractive for the task of class identification in spatial databases. However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

Here, local Moran's Iiand Gi{${_\ast}$}statistics are applied to the same set of distributional data to quantitatively characterize spatial autocorrelation of terminal monument dates at the local, not global, scale. The results raise a number of local-scale hypotheses that, though undetected by previous global spatial analyses, might lead to a refined interpretation of the spatial distribution of dated monuments and, by extension, the reorganization of the Classic Maya. In a more general sense, the present application to dated Maya monuments serves as one example of how local spatial statistics can further strengthen distributional archaeological interpretations.},

  abstract = {Commingled assemblages of fragmentary human skeletal remains are a common feature of many archaeological sites and pose significant analytical problems for bioarchaeologists. Such deposits often contain a high volume of the teeth of subadults for which it is challenging to estimate age, including developing permanent teeth with damaged roots, articulated teeth with roots obscured by alveolar bone, and deciduous teeth with completed root apices. Here, we present a new method for more precisely estimating age for the developmentally ambiguous teeth of subadults from archaeological contexts. We used a sample of articulated subadult dentition from the Copper Age site of Marroqu{\'i}es in Ja{\'e}n, Spain, to build linear models of the relationship between dental age and tooth wear for deciduous and permanent molars. We tested three different strategies for identifying and removing outliers to build a linear model with the strongest relationship between age and wear. The Adjusted Residual strategy, which used diagnostic plots of linear regression residuals in the statistical package R to identify and remove outliers, was found to produce the strongest linear model. The linear model developed using the Adjusted Residual strategy was then used to provide estimated midpoint ages and upper and lower age bounds based on the wear scores from the sample of developmentally ambiguous teeth. This study demonstrates that it is possible to estimate the age of developmentally ambiguous deciduous and permanent molars with reference to an adequate sample of subadult dentition with estimated ages from the same population. This new method is valuable as it extracts information from developmentally ambiguous teeth that would otherwise be inaccessible, allows for rapid data collection, employs standard macroscopic dental scoring methods, and can be used for sites from other regions and periods. We conclude by discussing the applications of this new method within bioarchaeology and identify directions for future research on subadult dental wear.},

  abstract = {Fluctuating asymmetry, the random deviation from perfect symmetry, is a widely used population-level index of developmental instability, developmental noise, and robustness. It reflects a population's state of adaptation and genomic coadaptation. Here, we review the literature on fluctuating asymmetry of human populations. The most widely used bilateral traits include skeletal, dental, and facial dimensions; dermatoglyphic patterns and ridge counts; and facial shape. Each trait has its advantages and disadvantages, but results are most robust when multiple traits are combined into a composite index of fluctuating asymmetry (CFA). Both environmental (diet, climate, toxins) and genetic (aneuploidy, heterozygosity, inbreeding) stressors have been linked to population-level variation in fluctuating asymmetry. In general, these stressors increase average fluctuating asymmetry. Nevertheless, there have been many conflicting results, in part because (1) fluctuating asymmetry is a weak signal in a sea of noise; and (2) studies of human fluctuating asymmetry have not always followed best practices. The most serious concerns are insensitive asymmetry indices (correlation coefficient and coefficient of indetermination), inappropriate size scaling, unrecognized mixture distributions, inappropriate corrections for directional asymmetry, failure to use composite indices, and inattention to measurement error. Consequently, it is often difficult (or impossible) to compare results across traits, and across studies.},

The increased accuracy and power of modern methods, versus conventional approaches to the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression, is remarkable.

  abstract = {This article is about a curious phenomenon. Suppose we have a data matrix, which is the superposition of a low-rank component and a sparse component. Can we recover each component individually? We prove that under some suitable assumptions, it is possible to recover both the low-rank and the sparse components exactly by solving a very convenient convex program called Principal Component Pursuit; among all feasible decompositions, simply minimize a weighted combination of the nuclear norm and of the {$\mathscr{l}$}1 norm. This suggests the possibility of a principled approach to robust principal component analysis since our methodology and results assert that one can recover the principal components of a data matrix even though a positive fraction of its entries are arbitrarily corrupted. This extends to the situation where a fraction of the entries are missing as well. We discuss an algorithm for solving this optimization problem, and present applications in the area of video surveillance, where our methodology allows for the detection of objects in a cluttered background, and in the area of face recognition, where it offers a principled way of removing shadows and specularities in images of faces.},
