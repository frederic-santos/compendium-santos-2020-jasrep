## Supporting Information

This repository contains the org source file of the original manuscript, thus making it a fully reproducible article using [Org mode for Emacs](https://orgmode.org/). Detailed instructions are available in the corresponding directory, [Org_manuscript](./Org_manuscript/)`.

For non Emacs users, a set of separate R source files also allows the replication of all the results presented in the article, and may be a starting point to build your own R scripts for outliers detection. All source files are independent (running all of them is not mandatory); and each Table or Figure is associated to an R source file. They can be found in the [R](./R/) directory.

The encoding system is UTF-8 for all source files.

Finally, the first draft of the manuscript (before any process of peer-review) can be accessed in its pdf version in the [Preprint](./Priprint/) directory.
